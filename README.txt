Procedure:
I.	Deriving mass of unseen companion
a.	Template fitting
i.	See spec5.pdf around page 20 where they go through how to do this. Use latex to write up general form and then my own form justifying why.
b.	Find mass
i.	Spec7 page 5 has eqs for finding mass. Also see whiteboard.
II.	Reducing spectra
a.	Spec5 has some stuff on the procedure. Page 26.
b.	Flat fielding
i.	Co-add flat fields -> remove cosmic rays
ii.	Normalize flat field to unity
iii.	Divide/multiply into science frames to get flat-field reduced science frames.
c.	Wavelength calibration
i.	Want lambda = f(x,y) which gives a lambda for each pixel pos on the CCD.
ii.	Steps
1.	Collapse 2d into 1D and plot. Easy.
"""microlensing
gammaray bursts - dunno how / when they happen. spurious.
xrays - only in close binaries
